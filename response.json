    "name": "dectes stem borer",
    "description": "Dectes texanus, commonly known as the Dectes Stem Borer, is a highly invasive insect pest found in North  America, particularly the Great Plains region. It belongs to the long-horned beetle family, Cerambycidae. The major host plants for this pest are soybeans, sunflowers and other crops like sesame and Jerusalem artichoke, making it a serious threat to agricultural crops. Its adult form is gray to black in color, and larvae are creamy white in color with a dark head capsule. The Dectes Stem Borer commonly lays their eggs on the leaves of host plants; upon hatching, the larvae bores into the stems to feed, causing significant damage. It is especially problematic during the late vegetative and reproductive stages of plant growth. The severity of this infestation often varies depending on environmental conditions.",
    "symptoms": [
      {
        "Stem breakage": " Plants may illustrate stem breakage at a higher level than normal, which is a result of the pest weakening the stem from the inside out."
      },
      {
        "Bore holes in stem": " Plant stems often show tiny hole marks, which are the entry and exit points of pests."
      },
      {
        "Yellowing of leaves": " The plant may show leaf yellowing, typically a sign of nutrient deficiency, which in this case might be due to damage to the stem which affects transportation of nutrients and moisture."
      },
      {
        "Crop yield reduction": " A severe infestation of Dectes Texanus can lead to significant reduction in crop yield due to damage caused to the plants."
      },
      {
        "Vigorous plant wilting": " The plant attacked by Dectes Texanus usually exhibits wilting symptoms due to stem boring that hinders nutrient transport."
      },
      {
        "Presence of larvae in stems": " Upon inspection, larvae of Dectes Texanus may be found inside the stems, confirming the pest's presence."
      },
      {
        "Dead plants with cut off stems": " Typically, invaded plants may die with the stem severed near the soil surface. This is caused by the larval feeding which cuts through plant tissues."
      },
      {
        "Pupal case sticking out of stem": " Pupal cases of Dectes Texanus might be noticed sticking out from the stem, indicating the completion of the larval stage inside the stem."
      }
    ],
    "severity": "This plant pest is extremely damaging especially to soybean crops, typically attacking during the plant's vegetative and reproductive stages. It bores into the main stem, inhibiting nutrient and water transportation, causing wilting, lodging, and death of the plant. Its potential for extensive damage makes it a severe threat to agricultural industries, particularly in regions where soybeans are a major crop. This pest can significantly reduce yield and crop quality, negatively impacting the financial return for farmers.",
    "treatment": {
      "prevention": [
        "Regular inspections: Conduct regular inspections of plants to detect early signs of infestation.",
        "Pruning: Prune and burn infested stems to prevent the spread of the pests.",
        "Clean farming: Maintain proper cleanliness and remove dead plant debris which could act as breeding sites.",
        "Crop rotation: Practice crop rotation which disrupts the lifecycle of the stem borer.",
        "Use of barriers: Install physical barriers like netting to prevent the pests from laying eggs on the plants."
      ],
      "chemical": [
        "Insecticide spray: Apply an insecticide specifically designed to kill the Dectes Stem Borer.",
        "Systemic Insecticides: Use systemic insecticides that penetrate the plant system and affect the pests feeding on them.",
        "Insecticidal soaps: Apply insecticidal soaps that can suffocate the pest on contact.",
        "Botanical Pesticides: Apply botanically-derived pesticides such as Pyrethrin or Rotenone that can effectively control the pest.",
        "Dusting of Diatomaceous Earth: Dust plants with Diatomaceous Earth to cause desiccation and death of these borers."
      ],
      "biological": [
        "Introduction of predators: Introduce insects like Ladybugs, Lacewings, and Parasitic Wasps that are natural predators of the Dectes Stem Borer.",
        "Usage of pathogens: Inject Beauveria Bassiana fungus, a natural pathogen to pests, into the plant which is effective on the stem borer.",
        "Release of Parasitic Nematodes: Utilize parasitic nematodes such as Steinernema and Heterorhabditis which can naturally control the pest.",
        "Intercropping: Use intercropping techniques with plants that deter Dectes Stem Borer as a biological control method.",
        "Installation of bird feeders: Install bird feeders as birds can eat the pests, offering a biological method of control."
